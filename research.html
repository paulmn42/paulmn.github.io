	<h1>User Research</h1>
	<hr width="75%" align="left"> 

	<p><b>User Interview</b><br>
			Interviews with potential users to understand them and to get requirements from them. My questions were semi-structured but mainly focuses on whether they used job searching websites, and what features would they include in a personal portfolio.<br>

		<b>Competitor Analysis</b> <br>
			An analysis and comparison of features of possible competitors of your product, service, or system. I compared a portfolio to Indeed.com, LinkedIn and UCI handshake as all of them are job searching websites and the main point of the portfolio is to allow companies to see your work and hire you.<br><br>

		<b>Feature Value Matrix</b> <br>
			A Matrix that compares features to user and business value, as well as dev effort. I choose features that would make sense to put with in a UX designer’s portfolio, along with general features that you would find in an online portfolio. <br><br>

		<b>Feature Prioritization</b> <br>
			I prioritized by how easy it was to implement and features that are found in my competitor Analysis.<br>

	<b>User Story</b> <br>
		User Stories are short stories that tell how users will use the system you made and can help detect usability issues. My user stories are told in the point of view of a hiring manager because that’s the most likely person to even go to my site. <br><br>

	<b>Cognitive walkthrough</b> <br>
		A Usability test where we have people follow step by step instructions and ask questions to find cognitive or usability issues. The hardest part of this step was trying to find people that had the time to do it. <br><br>

	<b>User Testing</b> <br>
		I choose a question test and a click test too see if there were any cognitive errors in the front page. The most difficult part was coming up with questions to ask. The main thing I got out from this is that I need to state my profession clearly. <br><br>

	<h3>Summary of Findings</h3>
	<hr width="75%" align="left">
	
	<p>
	The first test I did was the competitor’s analysis and it provided a base line for my entire project. The thing I learned from it was the more basic features. All the competitors had networking in some ways so contact information was the natural thing to incorporate. Something that all of them lack was the amount of customization, so I focused on really expressing myself, to the extent of my lack programing could afford. Next was the user interviews which gave me structure to the pages and told me which pages to implement as well as giving me clues to how to customize my web pages. Lastly was the feature matrix and prioritization which help me, well prioritize what features to add to my website <br> <br>
Next would be the users testing. User Stories remined me that I forgot to implement skills which was one the first things I fixed. The next thing I did was the usability hub testing, while the first the click test just wasn’t too helpful as people mostly clicked on the right thing the question test did reveal that I need to be clearer with my job description. Finally, would be my cognitive walkthrough. For the walkthrough with a student of my projects page need more structure and description. Next, for the walkthrough with the TA told me to take a professional head shot, and fix my contact page. Lastly, my sister pointed out grammatical errors and to elaborate on my about page.

	<h4>Incorporation of Findings</h4>
	<hr width="75%" align="left">
	<p>
	
	Easily, the biggest issue in implementing the features and findings was my lack of coding skills. I have never used HTML, CSS or Java Script. At one point I even confused CSS and Java Script as one in the same, that was a big mistake. Even outside of all the language we used I’m only mediocre at the other programming languages which compared to the rest of the ICS majors means I’m terrible at coding. It really didn’t help that we didn’t really have any coding exercises to help people like me get use to coding websites. So, my only solution was to use brute force. <br> <br>
As for implementing the changes it wasn’t to hard to make changes like grammar problems or content issues. However, there was one point where git hub ended up having a mental break down and ended up stopping me from updating the website for a while meaning I couldn’t make changes like adding in skills. There were also some weird problems with my picture for some reason but it eventually resolved on its own. <br>
Really for future plans I think I should add some Java Script to the web site as I ended up confusing CSS for Java Script, although I don't really know what Java Script would fit into my website. Other than that I think it will be a gradual proecess and probably will keep adding things as time goes on and my carree advances.
