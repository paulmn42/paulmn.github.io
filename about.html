	<h1>About me</h1>
	<img src="IMG_20171113_140448.jpg", alt="Picture of Paul Nguyen">
	<p id="Historyp">My name is Paul Nguyen, and I was born to immigrants from Vietnam. 
	My father is a big inspiration as he is currently a manager and computer engineer at a company called Macom.
	And he did it all in spite of the fact that he didn’t came with much when he came to this country. 
	So, I’m inspired by him to do my best and be just as successful as him. 
	I graduate from Irvine High school and will graduate from UCI in the winter quarter next year with a major in Informatics and HCI.
	</p>
	
	<h3>My Philosophy</h3>
	<p id="Philosophy">
	UX design and Human computer interactions is something that is not appreciated and in some cases ignored and over looked.
	Which is both a shame and will probably be a major problem in the future.
	From class I saw how things can go wrong, like people getting burned by x-rays, bridges falling apart, and terrible housing ideas.
	And most of these problems could have been averted with a little HCI and common sense.
	I wanted to become a UX designer to help avert theses disasters while also just making it easier for people to use technology.
	With technology getting more advanced and more complicated it can make life so much better, but it will all be useless if people can’t use them, so I want to make things easier for everyone, so things can get better.
	</p>
	
	<h4>My Intrests</h4>
	<p id="intrests">
	My number one interest are video games, I love playing them but I also like there design, for example how they can get people to do and learn things without people being too aware that something like that is happening.
	I love painting even though I haven’t done it in a while.
	I love learning and research about anything interesting, and maybe how to integrate what I learn in my design.
