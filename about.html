	<h1>About me</h1>
	<h2>My History</h2>
	<p id="Historyp">My name is Paul Nguyen, and I was born to immigrants from Vietnam. <br>
	My father is a big inspiration as he is currently a manager and computer engineer at a company called Macom. <br>
	And he did it all in spite of the fact that he didn’t came with much when he came to this country. <br>
	So, I’m inspired by him to do my best and be just as successful as him. <br>
	I graduate from Irvine High school and will graduate from UCI in the winter quarter next year with a major in Informatics and HCI.
	</p>
	
	<h3>My Philosophy</h3>
	<p id="Philosophy">
	UX design and Human computer interactions is something that is not appreciated and in some cases ignored and over looked.<br>
	Which is both a shame and will probably be a major problem in the future.<br>
	From class I saw how things can go wrong, like people getting burned by x-rays, bridges falling apart, and terrible housing ideas. <br>
	And most of these problems could have been averted with a little HCI and common sense.<br>
	I wanted to become a UX designer to help avert theses disasters while also just making it easier for people to use technology.<br>
	With technology getting more advanced and more complicated it can make life so much better, but it will all be useless if people can’t use them, so I want to make things easier for everyone, so things can get better.
	</p>
	
	<h4>My Intrests</h4>
	<p id="intrests">
	My number one interest are video games, I love playing them but I also like there design, for example how they can get people to do and learn things without people being too aware that something like that is happening.<br>
	I love painting even though I haven’t done it in a while. <br>
	I love learning and research about anything interesting, and maybe how to integrate what I learn in my design. <br>
