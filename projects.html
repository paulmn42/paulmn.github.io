	<p><b>UX designer at <a href="https://www.inwerks.com/"> Inwerks</a> 2016</b> <br><br>
	
	Description: A project for Informatics 117. Me and my team worked with Ali Sar as a sponser to help make the Inwerks website.
	At first we were tasked with creating a resume-to-job matching algorithm. However due to difficulty with implementing the algorith with the already existing base website,
	we had to re-build the website from the ground up. By the end of the quarter we had a fully functional website but we haven't had time to implement the matching altgorithm. <br>
	Inwerks is a website that is designed to be the next Linkedin with a better resume-to-job matching algorithm as well as more free options for users to use.
